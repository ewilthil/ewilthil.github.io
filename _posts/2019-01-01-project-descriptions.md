# Research projects
## aFerry
The postdoc is part of the aFerry project at NTNU, which is funded through FORNY2020 of [NFR](https://www.forskningsradet.no/) and [NTNU Discovery](https://ntnudiscovery.no/en/home/). The goal is to verify a prototype for an autonomous passenger ferry. See more about the project at <a href="https://www.ntnutto.no/prosjekter-items/a-ferry/">NTNU TTO</a>, and a presentation by Anders Aune from TTO at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsqQhgymrig">Enovakonferansen 2019</a>.

  My contributions to this project is to develop and verify the sitiational awareness algorithms deployed on the ferries. Urban autonomous ferries are expected to operate in more constrained environments compared to vessels at open sea. The goal is to adapt methods from my PhD, described below, to these ferries. Additionally, knowledge from the <a href="https://www.ntnu.edu/autoferry">autoFerry</a> project will be used to improve the situational awareness algorithms.

# Autosea
My PhD was part of the [Autosea](https://www.ntnu.edu/autosea) project, whose full name is <i>Sensor fusion and collision avoidance for autonomous surface vehicles (ASVs)</i>. In order to plan and execute a safe journey, ASVs require information on other ships and objects in the environment. My contribution is the calculation of this information by means of target tracking with a maritime radar.

The primary challenge with tracking with a low-cost radar is variations in performance. In my PhD, I looked at performance variations in the navigation system, the false alarm rate, and the detection probability. 

The results of the project has been widely disseminated, and some examples has been posted below. Additionally, several other projects will build upon the results of the Autosea project, such as [Autosit](https://www.ntnu.edu/autosit) and [Autoferry](https://www.ntnu.edu/autoferry).
