title: Research scientist, maritime situational awareness
summary: Expert on target tracking, sensor fusion and situational awareness, with focus on maritime applications. With a PhD from the Department of Engineering Cybernetics at NTNU, I have a strong theoretical background combined with valuable practical experience from full-scale field work.

work-experience:
    - title: Postdoctoral fellow
      employer: Norwegian University of Science and Technology
      start-time: 2019
      end-time: Present
      description: I work on sensors and situational awareness for a prototype of an autonomous urban passenger ferry. In urban environments, multiple sensors are needed to safely detect all objects within the vicinity of the ferry. Because of this, my current focus is on developing software for interfacing multiple sensors, and fuse them.

      description: My research focus was on target tracking for maritime collision avoidance, using a low-cost maritime radar. This was part of the Autosea research project, in collaboration with Maritime Robotics, Kongsberg Maritime and DNV GL. In addition to working on my PhD thesis, I was also a teaching assistant for three years.
